## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher (for Python examples)
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Willingness to learn best practices

## Why This Repo Exists 🤔

I created this repository after noticing a growing trend: many new developers rely heavily on AI coding assistants like Cursor, WindSurf, Bolt, and others to generate code, but often struggle when that code:

- Doesn't work as expected
- Contains security vulnerabilities
- Breaks under scale
- Is difficult to maintain

**This is not a critique of AI tools** - they're amazing productivity boosters! But they work best when you understand good programming practices.

## What You'll Find Here 📚

This repository contains practical, straightforward guides to coding best practices across various languages and frameworks:

- **Security practices** that AI might skip
- **Scalability patterns** for when your project grows
- **Maintainability tips** that make future-you happy
- **Testing strategies** to ensure your code actually works
- **Performance considerations** beyond just "make it run"
